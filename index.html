    <p>My name is Abdalla. I believe that every individual has unique characteristics which distinguish them from others. To be unique you must have an extraordinary spark or skill. I live with my family and my family members taught me to live together, adjust, help others, and be humble. Apart from this, I am an energetic person who loves to play football.
        I can manage my time because my mother taught me that time waits for no one. It is important to make correct use of time to succeed in life. If we value time, then only time will value us. My ambition in life is to become a successful gynaecologist and serve for human society.
        Hence, these are the qualities that describe me the best. Though no one can present themselves in a few words still I tried to give a brief about myself through this essay. In my opinion, life is meant to be lived with utmost happiness and an aim to serve humanity. Thus, keep this in mind, I will always try to help others and be the best version of myself.

        <ol><h2>football</h2> <p>
            The vast majority of people think football is just a sport. However, to me it has been one of the greatest things I have yet to do. It has given me a surplus of life skills I can carry to my adulthood. The time I have so far spent on the sport is time I would not want back, because of how useful it is to me. Throughout the past couple of years, which I have spent playing the sport, I have gained a love for football. The love is so massive, that I want to pursue a career that affiliates with the sport.

            The happiest moment in my life is when I playing the computer game, although I am not playing now, but the game makes me happy to let me can't forget that period of time. I have played many games when I was a child, story games, driving games, or another fighting games, in that time, we don't have a smartphone that we can't play games on the phone, so this computer games make me very impressed.
